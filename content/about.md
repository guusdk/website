The XMPP Developers Foundation is a collective of—and support structure for—open source developers who are building communication tools on top of the federated Jabber® network. The &lt;xdf/&gt; understands itself as the complement to the [XMPP Standards Foundation](https://xmpp.org).

#### Hackathons, Sprints & Meetups
Communication is key when trying to achieve a common goal. Sometimes virtual collaboration over Jabber just isn’t enough. Therefore the &lt;xdf/&gt; organizes events for developers to meet in person.
