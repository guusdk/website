The XMPP Developers Foundation is a collective of—and support structure for—open source developers who are building communication tools on top of the federated Jabber® network. The &lt;xdf/&gt; understands itself as the complement to the [XMPP Standards Foundation](https://xmpp.org).

#### Hackathons, Sprints & Meetups
Communication is key when trying to achieve a common goal. Sometimes virtual collaboration over Jabber just isn’t enough. Therefore the &lt;xdf/&gt; organizes events for developers to meet in person.

#### Lowering the barriers to entry
Attracting more developers to Jabber/XMPP is one of the main goals of the &lt;xdf/&gt;. This can be archieved by:

* Guiding interested developers to good documentation on how to get started with XMPP and creating such documentation where it doesn’t exits.
* Constantly maintaining a list of ›good first issues‹ to steer newcomers towards helping out existing projects instead of creating their own.

* Making historic discussions and decisions discoverable. The [XSF](https://xmpp.org) has a tendency to scatter their discussions over several channels. None of which are easy to search and therefore are only accessible to people who are constantly monitoring all those channels. All attempts to change that behaviour have been unsuccessful. The &lt;xdf/&gt; recognizes that mistake and focuses all its communication in [**one** online forum](https://discourse.xmpp-developers.foundation) that is easy to search.

#### GSoC and similar events
Most XMPP projects are too small to justify the organizational overhead of participating in events like [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). The &lt;xdf/&gt; will apply for future GSoC events and become the successor of the Conversations.IM organzation who applied on behalf of several small projects in 2017 and 2018.
